Note: VERSION NUMBER SEMANTICS
If you have committed a "big" change, increment the second number. 0.x.0
For every other small change, increment the second decimal 0.1.x
If you are working off the master branch, add the first letter of the branch
you are on to the end of the version number. ex, 0.3.2o (o for OOP branch)
